# What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and website security company, providing content delivery network (CDN) services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and distributed domain name server (DNS) services. Cloudflare's services sit between a website's visitor and the Cloudflare user's hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites.

Cloudflare's platform protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.

# Cloudflare Challenge
Cloudflare Challenge is a security feature provided by the Cloudflare infrastructure to protect websites from malicious traffic, attacks, and bot-like behavior. This mechanism functions as a part of Cloudflare's broader set of security protocols, including DDoS protection, rate limiting, bot management, and firewall settings.

When a user attempts to access a website that's protected by Cloudflare, the system assesses various factors to determine the legitimacy of the traffic. These factors could include the user's IP address, browsing patterns, and other behaviors that can signal whether the user is human or a potentially harmful bot.

If the system deems the user's behavior suspicious or bot-like, it triggers the Cloudflare Challenge. This challenge often takes the form of a CAPTCHA, which stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart." CAPTCHAs are designed to be easy for humans to solve but difficult for bots. They often involve identifying objects in images, deciphering distorted text, or solving simple puzzles.

Here is a text-based representation of a typical Cloudflare Challenge:

```
----------------------------------------------------------
|                      Cloudflare                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
|                                                        |
|   We are checking your browser...                      |
|                                                        |
|   Please complete the security check to access the     |
|   website.                                             |
|                                                        |
|   [ CAPTCHA Image ]                                    |
|                                                        |                                               |
|                                                        |
|   [ Click button for the CAPTCHA solution ]            |
|                                                        |
|   [ 'Submit' Button ]                                  |
|                                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
```

In the above representation, the user is presented with a CAPTCHA image, an input field to type in the solution, and a 'Submit' button to proceed. The CAPTCHA image can vary widely in its complexity and format, depending on the security settings of the specific website.

Upon successfully completing the CAPTCHA, the user is allowed to access the website. If they fail, they may be presented with another CAPTCHA or denied access entirely.

Cloudflare Challenge is an important tool in the ongoing fight against cyber threats. By distinguishing between legitimate human users and potentially harmful bots, it helps protect websites and their users from various types of malicious activities.
The Cloudflare Challenge is particularly effective because it is adaptive and responds to the evolving landscape of cyber threats. It employs machine learning algorithms to learn from past threats and apply that knowledge to new ones. As such, it can adapt to new types of bot behavior and refine its challenge mechanisms over time.

The challenge presented to the user is not random. It is based on the risk profile of the user's request, which is determined by numerous factors including the IP reputation, HTTP headers, and the behavior of the client. This intelligent risk assessment helps to provide a balance between security and user experience. 

In some cases, instead of presenting a CAPTCHA, Cloudflare may just add a slight delay to the website load time. This is known as a JavaScript challenge, where Cloudflare's server sends a piece of JavaScript code to the client's browser to check if it can execute it. This is based on the assumption that most legitimate browsers can execute JavaScript, while many bots cannot.

Here's another text representation showing a JavaScript challenge:

```
----------------------------------------------------------
|                      Cloudflare                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
|                                                        |
|   Checking your browser before accessing the website.  |
|                                                        |
|   This process is automatic. Your browser will         |
|   redirect to your requested content shortly.          |
|                                                        |
|   Please allow up to 5 seconds...                      |
|                                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
```

In this case, the user doesn't need to take any action. Their browser automatically handles the JavaScript code, and if successful, they will be redirected to the requested page.

Beyond the basic challenge mechanisms, Cloudflare offers several customization options for website owners. The owners can decide how aggressively they want the system to challenge visitors based on the risk threshold they set. They can also choose specific regions or IP ranges to always challenge or whitelist. This granular control allows each site to tailor Cloudflare's security measures to its unique needs and risk profile.

Moreover, Cloudflare integrates these challenge mechanisms with its analytics dashboard. This allows website owners to monitor the effectiveness of the challenges and understand the nature of the traffic their site is receiving. They can view how many requests were challenged, how many passed or failed the challenge, the countries from where these requests originated, and other details. 

Additionally, Cloudflare provides Under Attack Mode, a feature that can be enabled when a website is experiencing a significant security threat, like a DDoS attack. When this mode is enabled, all visitors to the site are presented with a Cloudflare Challenge, irrespective of their risk profile. This is a powerful tool for website owners to protect their site during periods of heightened risk.

It's also worth noting that Cloudflare maintains user privacy as a priority while providing these security measures. The data used for risk assessment is anonymized and used only for the duration of the visit. Cloudflare does not sell this data or use it for advertising purposes.

Here's a text representation of how the Under Attack Mode challenge might look:

```
----------------------------------------------------------
|                      Cloudflare                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
|                                                        |
|   We are checking your browser...                      |
|                                                        |
|   Please complete the security check to access the     |
|   website.                                             |
|                                                        |
|   [ CAPTCHA Image ]                                    |
|                                                        |                                               |
|                                                        |
|   [ Click button for the CAPTCHA solution ]            |
|                                                        |
|   [ 'Submit' Button ]                                  |
|                                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------
```

# How to solve Cloudflare Challenge (5s IUAM)

Before we start solving Cloudflare, there are some requeriments and points that we need to be aware that they are needed to know
**Requeriments:**
- Capsolver Key
- Proxy (Recommended [https://metaproxies.net/](https://metaproxies.net/))

**Points to be aware that if we don't follow, solution will be invalid:**
- `Token` returned in the response of the method getTaskResult is the value of the cookie `cf_clearance` that you will need to create.
- Must use the same user-agent that the method getTaskResult return
- Must use the same proxy IP used for solve the challenge

To solve cloudflare challenge, follow our [documentation](https://docs.capsolver.com/guide/antibots/cloudflare_challenge.html). **Some parameters are required and some are optional**. 
For this example, we will only use the required parameters. The task types for cloudflare are:

- ``AntiCloudflareTask``: This task type requires your own proxies.

We will use **AntiCloudflareTask** as the site uses Cloudflare Challenge 5s.
If any parameters are missing or you don't submit correctly, you will likely encounter issues with the token not being accepted by the website. You can find all the parameters in this picture:

![](https://assets.capsolver.com/prod/images/post/2023-05-11/dba0dcb5-1b8c-41a0-add6-f3d3f4c86fe8.png)


# Step 1: Submitting the information to capsolver
Use the method `createTask` to submit the information required:



```http
POST https://api.capsolver.com/createTask

{
{
 "clientKey":"Your_API_KEY",
    "task": {
    "type": "AntiCloudflareTask",
    "websiteURL": "https://cfschl.peet.ws/",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "challenge"
  },
  
  "html": "<your challenge html source code>",
  "proxy": "Your_proxy"
            
}
}
```
# Step 2: Getting the results

To verify the results, you'll need to continuously poll the `getTaskResult` API endpoint until the captcha is resolved. 

Here's an example request:

```http
POST https://api.capsolver.com/getTaskResult
Host: api.capsolver.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "clientKey":"YOUR_API_KEY",
    "taskId": "TASKID_OF_CREATETASK" //ID created by the createTask method
}

```
Once the captcha is successfully resolved, you'll receive a response similar to the one depicted in the following image:
![](https://assets.capsolver.com/prod/images/post/2023-05-11/15e454ae-a1c5-4d83-84ba-3ba501155279.png)


The captcha token received can be verified by submitting the cookie `cf_clearance` with the value of the response `token`, use the same proxy IP used for solve the challenge and also the same user-agent that we return you in the response to the relevant site. 

> ⚠️ **If the token is rejected, it may indicate that some information is missing or incorrect. Make sure that you are submitting the token value correctly to the cookie cf_clearance, that you are using the same proxy IP used for solve the challenge and also the same user-agent that it's returned to you in the response.**
